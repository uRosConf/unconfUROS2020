# unconfUROS2020
The annual [conference on the use of R in official statistics](http://urosconf.org) will take place on the premises of Statistics Austria 2-4 December 2020. We are excited to announce an unconference "use of R in official statistics"" on the two days before the uRos2020 conference, so on 30 November and 1 December.

## Motivation
The idea behind the event (similar to http://unconf17.ropensci.org/ for R in general) to bring together useRs from the area of official statistics to work for two days on concrete projects where enhancements would benefit many institutes, organisation,... .

Similar to the idea of the [awesome official statistics software](http://www.awesomeofficialstatistics.org) list, this should complement an abstract top-down approach such as the [common statistical production architecture](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/CSPA/CSPA+v1.5) with fast bottom-up solutions.

## Participation
If you are interested in participating, please contact us by email to [anamaria.dobre@insse.ro](mailto:anamaria.dobre@insse.ro) with a short summary of your motivation and your experience in R.

## Call for ideas
If you have an idea what should be implemented, please write [us](mailto:anamaria.dobre@insse.ro) or even better clone this repo, add a small markdown file describing your idea to the doc folder in this repo and send a pull request to us. The ideas should be useful for producers or users of official statistics. To give a hint what kind of proposals we are aiming for, please see the implemented projects from the [unconfUROS2018](https://github.com/uRosConf/unconfUROS2018).
