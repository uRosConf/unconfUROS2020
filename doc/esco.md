## An R package for downloading ESCO data

[ESCO](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/home) is the European onthology for
Skills/Competences qualifications and Occupations. It can provide a helpful
resource, for example for classifying online vacancy advertisements.

The ontology is available through a REST API. Currently there appears to be no
R client package to easily search and download data from the API.

In this project an R package will be developed to easily obtain information
from the ESCO portal.
